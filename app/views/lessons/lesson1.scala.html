An interpreter (REPL) can be seen as a fancy calculator.
</p>
<p>
A user interacts with the calculator by typing in expressions. The calculator returns the evaluation results and their types.
</p>
<p>
Type for example <code>87 + 145</code> and you will see what I mean.
</p>
<p>
Type <code>:next</code> when you are ready to go to the next step.
